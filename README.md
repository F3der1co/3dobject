If you fork this project and expect to distribute the new version, create a new addon id, so that it won't conflict with the original addon.
See: https://www.construct.net/en/make-games/manuals/addon-sdk/guide/configuring-plugins for more info.

To create a 'release' (zipped version), on mac or linux you can use the release script: ./release.sh 2-58-1
